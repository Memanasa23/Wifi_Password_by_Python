# Wifi_Password_by_Python

Developed a Python script to retrieve saved Wi-Fi passwords from a Windows system using the netsh command. The script automates the extraction of stored network credentials, handles errors gracefully, and presents the data in a structured format. Implemented robust exception handling, optimized data processing, and improved output readability. This project demonstrates expertise in Python scripting, subprocess handling, and system automation for network security analysis.
